Dubbed the startup that’s harder to get into than Harvard by CNN, we sift through tens of thousands of applicants so you don't have to. At Andela we believe there is no excuse for having fewer female software developers. Based on open source research, aptitude assessments, and the satisfaction of our clients, we know that talent is gender-neutral. Andela is committed to driving change for women in technology — and we’re starting with all-female cohorts, mentoring young women in tech, and ensuring a safe, secure, and fair work environment.
