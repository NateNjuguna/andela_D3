						Andela extends engineering teams with world-class software developers. We recruit the most talented developers on the African continent, shape them into technical leaders, and place them as full-time distributed team members with companies that range from Microsoft and IBM to dozens of high-growth startups. Backed by Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, GV (Google Ventures) and Spark Capital, Andela is building the next generation of global technology leaders.

						Dubbed the startup that’s harder to get into than Harvard by CNN, we sift through tens of thousands of applicants so you don't have to. At Andela we believe there is no excuse for having fewer female software developers. Based on open source research, aptitude assessments, and the satisfaction of our clients, we know that talent is gender-neutral. Andela is committed to driving change for women in technology — and we’re starting with all-female cohorts, mentoring young women in tech, and ensuring a safe, secure, and fair work environment. Join us. When your message is concrete, then your audience has a clear picture of what you're telling them. There are details (but not too many!) and vivid facts, and there's laser-like focus. Your message is solid.

						Andela’s pipeline of vetted tech talent allows you to scale your team while minimizing hiring time and effort. Andela developers will be with you longer and grow into leaders on your team. Andela is built upon a self-funding model of education — instead of charging tuition, we enable our developers to finance their own education through their work. As a result, Andela attracts both working professionals and high-achieving college graduates.

						Andela selects the top 1% of tech talent from the largest pool of untapped talent in the world—the African continent. Dubbed the startup that’s harder to get into than Harvard by CNN, we sift through tens of thousands of applicants so you don't have to.

						There are 5 job openings for every software developer looking for a job in the United States. Africa, meanwhile, has the youngest, fastest-growing population on earth, with more people joining the labor force over the next 20 years than the rest of the world combined. By connecting top employers to the brightest individuals on the African continent, Andela provides a bridge to close the talent gap while investing in the smartest, most creative minds in software development. How do we design learning tech for human transformation? @Andela's @grow_curious kicks off a blog series to explain. https://t.co/oQ62GN1oPr
